# The port number on which to listen for data.
# Note: Every VPN needs a different port number.
#port: 3210

# Address of a peer to connect to. The address should be in the form
# `addr:port`. If the node is not started, the connection will be retried
# periodically. This parameter can be repeated to connect to multiple peers.
# Note: Several entries can be separated by spaces.
#peers:
#  - node2.address:3210
#  - node3.address:3210

# Peer timeout in seconds. The peers will exchange information periodically
# and drop peers that are silent for this period of time.
#peer_timeout: 1800

# Switch table entry timeout in seconds. This parameter is only used in switch
# mode. Addresses that have not been seen for the given period of time  will
# be forgot.
#dst_timeout: 300

# An optional token that identifies the network and helps to distinguish it
# from other networks.
#magic: "76706e01"

# An optional shared key to encrypt the VPN data. If this option is not set,
# the traffic will be sent unencrypted.
#shared_key: ""

# The encryption method to use ("aes256", or "chacha20"). Most current CPUs
# have special support for AES256 so this should be faster. For older
# computers lacking this support, only CHACHA20 is supported.
#crypto: chacha2

# Name of the virtual device. Any `%d` will be filled with a free number.
#device_name: "vpncloud%d"

# Set the type of network. There are two options: **tap** devices process
# Ethernet frames **tun** devices process IP packets. [default: `tap`]
#device_type: tap

# The mode of the VPN. The VPN can like a router, a switch or a hub. A **hub**
# will send all data always to all peers. A **switch** will learn addresses
# from incoming data and only send data to all peers when the address is
# unknown. A **router** will send data according to known subnets of the
# peers and ignore them otherwise. The **normal** mode is switch for tap
# devices and router for tun devices. [default: `normal`]
#mode: normal

# The local subnets to use. This parameter should be in the form
# `address/prefixlen` where address is an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a
# MAC address. The prefix length is the number of significant front bits that
# distinguish the subnet from other subnets. Example: `10.1.1.0/24`.
# Note: Several entries can be separated by spaces.
#subnets:
#  - 10.1.1.0/24

# A command to setup the network interface. The command will be run (as
# parameter to `sh -c`) when the device has been created to configure it.
# The name of the allocated device will be available via the environment
# variable `IFNAME`.
#ifup: ""

# A command to bring down the network interface. The command will be run (as
# parameter to `sh -c`) to remove any configuration from the device.
# The name of the allocated device will be available via the environment
# variable `IFNAME`.
