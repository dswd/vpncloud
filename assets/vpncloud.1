\fB\-\-config <file>\fP
.RS 4
Read configuration options from the specified file. Please see the section
\fBCONFIG FILES\fP for documentation on the file format.
If the same option is defined in the config file and as a parameter, the
parameter overrides the config file.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t <type>\fP, \fB\-\-type <type>\fP
.RS 4
Set the type of network. There are two options: \fBtap\fP devices process
Ethernet frames \fBtun\fP devices process IP packets. [default: \fBtap\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d <name>\fP, \fB\-\-device <name>\fP
.RS 4
Name of the virtual device. Any \fB%d\fP will be filled with a free number.
[default: \fBvpncloud%d\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-device\-path <path>\fP
.RS 4
The path of the base device inode, e.g. /dev/net/run.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m <mode>\fP, \fB\-\-mode <mode>\fP
.RS 4
The mode of the VPN. The VPN can like a router, a switch or a hub. A \fBhub\fP
will send all data always to all peers. A \fBswitch\fP will learn addresses
from incoming data and only send data to all peers when the address is
unknown. A \fBrouter\fP will send data according to known subnets of the
peers and ignore them otherwise. The \fBnormal\fP mode is switch for tap
devices and router for tun devices. [default: \fBnormal\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l <addr>\fP, \fB\-\-listen <addr>\fP
.RS 4
The address on which to listen for data. This can be simply a port number
or a full address in form IP:PORT. If the IP is specified as \(aq\(rs*\(aq or only
a port number is given, then the socket will listen on all IPs (v4 and v6),
otherwise the socket will only listen on the given IP. [default: \fB3210\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c <addr>\fP, \fB\-\-connect <addr>\fP
.RS 4
Address of a peer to connect to. The address should be in the form
\fBaddr:port\fP. If the node is not started, the connection will be retried
periodically. This parameter can be repeated to connect to multiple peers.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s <subnet>\fP, \fB\-\-subnet <subnet>\fP:
  The local subnets to use. This parameter should be in the form
  \fBaddress/prefixlen\fP where address is an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a
  MAC address. The prefix length is the number of significant front bits that
  distinguish the subnet from other subnets. Example: \fB10.1.1.0/24\fP.
.sp
\fB\-\-shared\-key <key>\fP
.RS 4
An optional shared key to encrypt the VPN data. If this option is not set,
the traffic will be sent unencrypted.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-crypto <method>\fP
.RS 4
The encryption method to use ("aes256", or "chacha20"). Most current CPUs
have special support for AES256 so this should be faster. For older
computers lacking this support, only CHACHA20 is supported.
[default: \fBchacha20\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-magic <id>\fP
.RS 4
Override the 4\-byte magic header of each packet. This header identifies the
network and helps to distinguish it from other networks and other
applications. The id can either be a 4 byte / 8 character hexadecimal
string or an arbitrary string prefixed with "hash:" which will then be
hashed into 4 bytes.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-peer\-timeout <secs>\fP
.RS 4
Peer timeout in seconds. The peers will exchange information periodically
and drop peers that are silent for this period of time. [default: \fB600\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-keepalive <secs>\fP
.RS 4
Interval of peer exchange messages in seconds. The peers will exchange
information periodically to keep connections alive. This setting overrides
how often this will happen. [default: \fBpeer\-timeout/2\-60\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-dst\-timeout <secs>\fP
.RS 4
Switch table entry timeout in seconds. This parameter is only used in switch
mode. Addresses that have not been seen for the given period of time  will
be forgotten. [default: \fB300\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-beacon\-store <path|command>\fP
.RS 4
Periodically store beacons containing the address of this node in the given
file or via the given command. If the parameter value starts with a pipe
character (\fB|\fP), the rest of the value is interpreted as a shell command.
Otherwise the value is interpreted as a file to write the beacon to.
If this parameter is not given, beacon storage is disabled.
Please see the section \fBBEACONS\fP for more information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-beacon\-load <path|command>\fP
.RS 4
Periodically load beacons containing the addresses of other nodes from the
given file or via the given command. If the parameter value starts with a
pipe character (\fB|\fP), the rest of the value is interpreted as a shell
command. Otherwise the value is interpreted as a file to read the beacon
from.
If this parameter is not given, beacon loading is disabled.
Please see the section \fBBEACONS\fP for more information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-beacon\-interval <secs>\fP
.RS 4
Beacon storage/loading interval in seconds. If configured to do so via
\fB\-\-beacon\-store\fP and \fB\-\-beacon\-load\fP, the node will periodically store its
beacon and load beacons of other nodes. This parameter defines the interval
in seconds. [default: \fB3600\fP]
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-ifup <command>\fP
.RS 4
A command to setup the network interface. The command will be run (as
parameter to \fBsh \-c\fP) when the device has been created to configure it.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBVpnCloud\fP is a simple VPN over UDP. It creates a virtual network interface on
the host and forwards all received data via UDP to the destination. It can work
in 3 different modes:
.sp
\fBSwitch mode\fP
.RS 4
In this mode, the VPN will dynamically learn addresses
as they are used as source addresses and use them to forward data to its
destination. Addresses that have not been seen for some time
(option \fBdst_timeout\fP) will be forgotten. Data for unknown addresses will be
broadcast to all peers. This mode is the default mode for TAP devices that
process Ethernet frames but it can also be used with TUN devices and IP
packets.
.RE
.sp
\fBHub mode\fP
.RS 4
In this mode, all data will always be broadcast to all peers.
This mode uses lots of bandwidth and should only be used in special cases.
.RE
.sp
\fBRouter mode\fP
.RS 4
In this mode, data will be forwarded based on preconfigured
address ranges ("subnets"). Data for unknown nodes will be silently ignored.
This mode is the default mode for TUN devices that work with IP packets but
it can also be used with TAP devices and Ethernet frames.
.RE
.sp
All connected VpnCloud nodes will form a peer\-to\-peer network and cross\-connect
automatically until the network is fully connected. The nodes will periodically
exchange information with the other nodes to signal that they are still active
and to allow the automatic cross\-connect behavior. There are some important
things to note:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
To avoid that different networks that reuse each others addresses merge due
to the cross\-connect behavior, the \fBmagic\fP option can be used and set
to any unique string to identify the network. The \fBmagic\fP must be the
same on all nodes of the same VPN network.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
The cross\-connect behavior can be able to connect nodes that are behind
firewalls or NATs as it can function as hole\-punching.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP " 3." 4.2
.\}
The management traffic will increase with the peer number quadratically.
It should still be reasonably small for high node numbers (below 10 KiB/s
for 10.000 nodes). A longer \fBpeer_timeout\fP can be used to reduce the traffic
further. For high node numbers, router mode should be used as it never
broadcasts data.
.RE
.sp
VpnCloud does not implement any loop\-avoidance. Since data received on the UDP
socket will only be sent to the local network interface and vice versa, VpnCloud
cannot produce loops on its own. On the TAP device, however STP data can be
transported to avoid loops caused by other network components.
.sp
For TAP devices, IEEE 802.1q frames (VLAN tagged) are detected and forwarded
based on separate MAC tables. Any nested tags (Q\-in\-Q) will be ignored.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.SS "Switched TAP scenario"
.sp
In the example scenario, a simple layer 2 network tunnel is established. Most
likely those commands need to be run as \fBroot\fP using \fBsudo\fP.
.sp
First, VpnCloud need to be started on both nodes (the address after \fB\-c\fP is the
address of the remote node and the the \fBX\fP in the interface address must be
unique among all nodes, e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
vpncloud \-c REMOTE_HOST:PORT \-\-ifup \(aqifconfig $IFNAME 10.0.0.X/24 mtu 1400 up\(aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Afterwards, the interface can be used to communicate.
.SS "Routed TUN example"
.sp
In this example, 2 nodes and their subnets should communicate using IP.
First, VpnCloud need to be started on both nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
vpncloud \-t tun \-c REMOTE_HOST:PORT \-\-subnet 10.0.X.0/24 \-\-ifup \(aqifconfig $IFNAME 10.0.X.1/16 mtu 1400 up\(aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
It is important to configure the interface in a way that all addresses on the
VPN can be reached directly. E.g. if subnets 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24 and so on
are used, the interface needs to be configured as 10.0.1.1/16.
For TUN devices, this means that the prefix length of the subnets
(/24 in this example) must be different than the prefix length that the
interface is configured with (/16 in this example).
.SS "Important notes"
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
VpnCloud can be used to connect two separate networks. TAP networks can be
bridged using \fBbrctl\fP and TUN networks must be routed. It is very important
to be careful when setting up such a scenario in order to avoid network loops,
security issues, DHCP issues and many more problems.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
TAP devices will forward DHCP data. If done intentionally, this can be used
to assign unique addresses to all participants. If this happens accidentally,
it can conflict with DHCP servers of the local network and can have severe
side effects.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP " 3." 4.2
.\}
VpnCloud is not designed for high security use cases. Although the used crypto
primitives are expected to be very secure, their application has not been
reviewed.
The shared key is hashed using \fIScryptSalsa208Sha256\fP to derive a key,
which is used to encrypt the payload of messages using \fIChaCha20Poly1305\fP or
\fIAES256\-GCM\fP. The encryption includes an authentication that also protects the
header.
This method does only protect against attacks on single messages but not
against attacks that manipulate the message series itself (i.e. suppress
messages, reorder them, or duplicate them).

The beacons are very robust. They only consist of alphanumeric characters
and can be interleaved with non\-alphanumeric characters (e.g. whitespace).
Also the beacons contain a prefix and suffix that depends on the configured
network magic and secret key (if set) so that all nodes can find beacons in
a long text.
.sp
When beacons are stored or loaded via a command (using the pipe character \fB|\fP),
the command is interpreted using the configured shell \fBsh\fP. This command has
access to the following environment variables:
.sp
\fB$begin\fP
.RS 4

All the local subnets claimed by the nodes

Its first byte marks the stage of the initial handshake process.
The next 16 bytes contain the unique node id. After that,
the list of local subnets follows.
The subnet list is encoded in the following way: Its first byte of data
contains the number of encoded subnets that follow. After that, the given
number of encoded subnets follow.
For each subnet, the first byte is the length of bytes in the base address
and is followed by the given number of base address bytes and one additional
byte that is the prefix length of the subnet.
The addresses for the subnet will be encoded like they are encoded in their
native protocol (4 bytes for IPv4, 16 bytes for IPv6, and 6 bytes for a MAC
address) with the exception of MAC addresses in a VLan which will be encoded
in 8 bytes where the first 2 bytes are the VLan number in network byte order
and the later 6 bytes are the MAC address.

\fBClosing message\fP (message type 3)

This packet does not contain any more data.

Nodes are expected to send an \fBinitial message\fP with stage 0 whenever they
connect to a node they were not connected to before. As a reply to this message,
another initial should be sent with stage 1. Also a \fBpeer list\fP message should
be sent as a reply.
.sp
When connected, nodes should periodically send their \fBpeer list\fP to all
of their peers to spread this information and to avoid peer timeouts.
To avoid the cubic growth of management traffic, nodes should at a certain
network size start sending partial peer lists instead of the full list. A
reasonable number would be about 20 peers. The subsets should be selected
randomly.
.sp
Nodes should remove peers from their peer list after a certain period of
inactivity or when receiving a \fBclosing message\fP. Before shutting down, nodes
should send the closing message to all of their peers in order to avoid
receiving further data until the timeout is reached.
.sp
Nodes should only add nodes to their peer list after receiving an initial
message from them instead of adding them right from the peer list of another
peer. This is necessary to avoid the case of a large network keeping dead nodes
alive.
